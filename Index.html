  <h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
<p>Hello beautiful people! My name is Bayleigh Clock and I am a Sophomore at Lesley University College of Art and Design in the Graphic Design program. I grew up in Exeter, New Hampshire but I have always been traveling into the city for fun. I have always been drawn (literally and figurtatively) to art and everything that I can create with it. Growing up, I have always been encoraged to be <strong>creative</strong> and let my personality show in whatever way I want. <br>I have a service dog whom I love and is my absolute best friend (no matter how stinky he is). I am learning how to play Dungeons and Dragons on the weekends with my new friend group. I enjoy taking the train on the weekend and going home to play with all of my animals that I have at home.</p>
